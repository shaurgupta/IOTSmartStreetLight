# IOTSmartStreetLight

Smart led street lighting system proposes to design and execute the recent advanced development in IOT for energy savings of street lights. The best solution for the reduction of electrical power wastage is the automation of street light and for the manual operation of the lighting system to be completely eliminated. A method for modifying street light illumination is by using sensor at minimum electrical energy consumption, such as when an objects presence is detected, street lights will glow at their brightest, else they would stay in the dim mode during the night time. Internet of things (IOT) is used to visualize the real time updates of street processing and notifying the changes that occur and in what period of time. This would reduce power consumption, maintenance heat emissions, and replacement costs.
